          While studying at Rochester Institute of Technology, I developed a strong interest in backend systems, coding, and cybersecurity. Through labs and group projects, I got hands-on experience applying what I learned in class to real-world scenarios, which really helped me understand how to build secure and scalable systems.

          Outside of coursework, I was involved in clubs like RITSEC, RC3, and SPARSA, where I took part in competitions such as IRSec and NSIC. These experiences helped me grow as a team player, problem solver, and communicator in all kinds of settings.
